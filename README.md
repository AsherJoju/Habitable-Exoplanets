# Habitable Exoplanets - Planet Generation
AstroSim - Planet Generation is a Python-based project developed using the Ursina Game Engine, aiming to simulate and generate random planets.

# How To Run
Install [Python](python.org) and run [planet_editor.py](planet_editor.py).
At the start, after the imports, there are some variables (constants) in UPPERCASE. Those are the input values, or what you have to edit in order to chnage the look of the planet.

# Input Variables
**RESOLUTION** - Resolution of the planet (Level Of Detail)
**SUN_MASS** and **PLANET_DISTANCE** - Used to calculate temprature. They are intented to be set to _Real World Values_ like Solar Masses or Astronomical Units.
**SEA_LEVEL** - Sea Level (Effects how much land is there) **WARNING: This is bugged, DON'T CHANGE**
**RADIUS** - Radius of the plamnet (scales the planet)
**SEA_COLOR**, **FLORA_COLOR** and **ROCK_COLOR** - Sea color, plant color and rock color, effecting sea, land and mountains.
